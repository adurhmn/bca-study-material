            <ol>
              <li>
                Testing is the process using which we find errors and bugs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing starts with known conditions, uses predefined procedures
                and has predictable outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing can, and should be planned, designed and scheduled
              </li>
              <li>
                One does not need any design knowledge to perform testing.
              </li>
              <li>Both insiders and outsiders can perform testing.</li>
              <li>Much of test execution and design can be automated</li>
              <li>
                Testing is a stage of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).
              </li>
              <li>
                This process can begin after we have completed writing the code.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Debugging</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Debugging is the process using which we correct the bugs that we
                found during the testing process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Debugging starts from possibly unknown initial conditions and
                the end cannot be predicted except statistically
              </li>
              <li>
                Procedure and duration of debugging cannot be so constrained
              </li>
              <li>Debugging is impossible without detailed design knowledge</li>
              <li>Debugging must be done by an insider</li>
              <li>Automated debugging is still a dream</li>
              <li>
                Debugging is not at all an aspect of the SDLC. It rather occurs
                as a consequence of the process of testing.
              </li>
              <li>
                This process can begin after the execution of the test case and
                the identification of errors.

            <h4>Phase 1:&nbsp;Static Testing (Requirements Testing)</h4>
            <p>
              During static testing, developers work to avoid potential problems
              that might arise later. Without executing the code, they perform
              manual or automated reviews of the supporting documents for the
              software, such as requirement specifications, looking for any
              potential ambiguities, errors or redundancies. The goal is to
              preempt defects before introducing them to the software system.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 2:&nbsp;Unit Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[2 Mark] [5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The next phase of software testing is unit testing. During this
              phase, the software undergoes assessments of its specific units,
              or its functions and procedures, to ensure that each works
              properly on its own. The developers may use white box testing to
              evaluate the software's code and internal structure, commonly
              before delivering the software for formal testing by testers. Unit
              testing can occur whenever a piece of code undergoes change, which
              allows for quick resolution of issues.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 3:&nbsp;Integration Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Integration testing involves testing all the units of a program as
              a group in order to find issues with how the separate software
              functions interact with one another. Through integration testing,
              the developers can determine the overall efficiency of the units
              as they run together. This phase is important because the
              program's overall functionality relies on the units operating
              simultaneously as a complete system, not as isolated procedures.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 4:&nbsp;System Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              In the system testing phase, the software undergoes its first test
              as a complete, integrated application to determine how well it
              carries out its purpose. For this, the developers pass the
              software to independent testers who had no involvement in its
              development in order to ensure that the testing results stem from
              impartial evaluations. System testing is vital because it ensures
              that the software meets the requirements as determined by the
              client.
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 5:&nbsp;Acceptance Testing (User Acceptance Testing)</h4>
            <p>
              Acceptance testing is the last phase of software testing. Its
              purpose is to evaluate the software's readiness for release and
              practical use. Testers may perform acceptance testing alongside
              individuals who represent the software's target audience.
              Acceptance testing aims to show whether the software meets the
              needs of its intended users and that any changes the software
              experienced during development are appropriate for use. Once the
              software passes acceptance testing, it moves on to production.

            <p>
              A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce
              invalid output. The problem is caused by insufficient or erroneous
              logic. A bug can be an error, mistake, defect, or fault, which may
              cause failure or deviation from expected results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software bugs should be caught during the testing phase of the
              software development life cycle, but some can go undetected until
              after deployment.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of bugs:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Logic bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the types of coding errors that can cause the program
                  to output incorrectly or even freeze or crash. For example, an
                  infinite loop would cause the program to repeat the sequence
                  of actions indefinitely until it crashes or halts due to
                  external intervention, such as the program closing or a power
                  outage.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Calculation errors</h4>
                <p>
                  Calculation errors may occur due to bad logic, an incorrect
                  formula, a data type mismatch or a coding error. Calculation
                  errors can be serious. For example, a calculation error in a
                  banking system can result in loss of money. Fixing the
                  calculation error is typically just a matter of math.

              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Functional Errors</h4>
                <p>
                  This type of error occurs whenever software does not behave as
                  intended. For example, a Login button doesn’t allow users to
                  login, an Add to cart button that doesn’t update the cart,
                  etc. So basically, any component in an app or website that
                  doesn’t function as intended is a functional bug.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Security bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  Security errors are perhaps one of the most severe defects,
                  making the project vulnerable. This type of bugs opens the
                  software, company, and customers to a potential intense
                  attack.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Syntax errors</h4>
                <p>
                  Such errors occur in the program’s source code and prevent the
                  program from compiling correctly. This type of defect is
                  widespread and usually occurs when there are one or more
                  missing or incorrect characters in the code. For example,
                  missing one parenthesis can cause a syntax error.

              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Compatibility errors</h4>
                <p>
                  These software bugs occur when an application does not run
                  consistently across different hardware, operating systems, and
                  browsers.
                </p>

                <h4>Performance bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  This is a type of software bug, related to speed, stability,
                  response time, and software resource consumption. Such defects
                  are discovered during the performance testing phase.

              <!-- <li>
                <h4>Usability defects</h4>
                <p>
                  A usability defect makes the software difficult or
                  inconvenient, such as a complex registration form. This type
                  of error prevents the user from using the software to its full
                  potential. Software engineers and UX designers must review
                  their software against the Web Content Accessibility
                  Guidelines and other usability requirements to detect such
                  errors.

                <p>
                  This type of error arises when a communication breakdown
                  occurs between software and the end-user. For example. a
                  communication bug is bound to occur during the software use if
                  it contains undocumented features. For seamless and effective
                  communication between both parties, software should be easy to
                  use and provide all necessary instructions and recommendations
                  for users to interact with a program.

            <p>
              Model-based testing is a software testing technique in which the
              test cases are derived from a model that describes the functional
              aspects of the system under test. It makes use of a model to
              generate tests that includes both offline and online testing.
              Model based testing is the modern approach to software testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              A model is a description of a system’s behavior. Behavior can be
              described in terms of input sequences, actions, conditions, output
              and flow of data from input to output. It should be practically
              understandable and can be reusable; shareable must have a precise
              description of the system under test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Model-Based Testing describes how a system behaves in response to
              an action (determined by a model). Supply action, and see, if the
              system responds as per the expectation. It is a lightweight formal
              method to validate a system.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of MBT</h4>
            <p>There are two types of Model based testing framework:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Offline / a priori:</span> Generation
                  of Test Suites before executing it. A test suite is nothing
                  but a collection of test cases.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Online / on-the-fly:</span> Generation
                  of Test Suites during test execution.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Different models in testing</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Finite state machines:</h4>
                <p>
                  This model helps testers to assess the result depending on the
                  input selected. There can be various combinations of the
                  inputs which result in a corresponding state of the system.
                  The system will have a specific state and current state which
                  is governed by a set of inputs given from the testers.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>State charts</h4>
                <p>
                  It is an extension of Finite state machine and can be used for
                  complex and real time systems. Statecharts are used to
                  describe various behaviors of the system. It has a definite
                  number of states. The behavior of the system is analyzed and
                  represented in the form of events for each state.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Unified modeling language (UML)</h4>
                <p>
                  Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized
                  general-purpose modeling language. UML includes a set of
                  graphic notation techniques to create visual models of that
                  can describe very complicated behavior of the system.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages of Model Testing</h4>
            <ul>

            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A transaction is a unit of work seen from a system user's
                  point of view.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A transaction consists of a sequence of operations, some of
                  which are performed by a system, persons or devices that are
                  outside of the system
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Transaction flows are indispensable for specifying
                  requirements of complicated systems, especially online
                  systems.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
              A transaction for an online information retrieval system might
              consist of the following steps or tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Accept input (tentative birth)</p></li>
              <li><p>Validate input (birth)</p></li>
              <li><p>Transmit acknowledgement to requester</p></li>
              <li><p>Do input processing</p></li>
              <li><p>Search file</p></li>
              <li><p>Request directions from user</p></li>
              <li><p>Accept input</p></li>
              <li><p>Validate input</p></li>
              <li><p>Process request</p></li>
              <li><p>Update file</p></li>
              <li><p>Transmit output</p></li>
              <li><p>Record transaction in log and clean up (death)</p></li>

              <span>Transaction Flow - Techniques</span>
            </h4>
            <h4>Get the transaction flows:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Complicated systems that process a lot of different,
                  complicated transactions should have explicit representations
                  of the transactions flows, or the equivalent.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Transaction flows are like control flow graphs, and
                  consequently we should expect to have them in increasing
                  levels of detail.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The system's design documentation should contain an overview
                  section that details the main transaction flows.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Detailed transaction flows are a mandatory prerequisite to the
                  rational design of a system's functional testing.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Transaction flow is sequence of steps for a system to be tested.
              The transaction flow begins at the preliminary design and
              continues as the project progresses. The following testing
              strategies has been taken.
            </p>
            <h4>Inspections, Reviews and Walkthroughs:</h4>
            <p>
              Transaction flows are natural agenda for system reviews or
              inspections. In conducting the walkthroughs, you should:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discuss enough transaction types to account for 98%-99% of the
                  transaction the system is expected to process.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discuss paths through flows in functional rather than
                  technical terms.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ask the designers to relate every flow to the specification
                  and to show how that transaction, directly or indirectly,
                  follows from the requirements.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Make transaction flow testing the cornerstone of system
                  functional testing just as path testing is the cornerstone of
                  unit testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select additional flow paths for loops, extreme values, and
                  domain boundaries.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Design more test cases to validate all births and deaths.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Publish and distribute the selected test paths through the
                  transaction flows as early as possible so that they will exert
                  the maximum beneficial effect on the project.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Selection:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select a set of covering paths (c1+c2) using the analogous
                  criteria that were used for structural path testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select a covering set of paths based on functionally sensible
                  transactions, as you would for control flow graphs.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Try to find the most tortuous, longest, strangest path from
                  the entry to the exit of the transaction flow.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Sensitization:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Most of the normal paths are very easy to sensitize-80% - 95%
                  transaction flow coverage (c1+c2) is usually easy to achieve.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The remaining small percentage is often very difficult.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Sensitization is the act of defining the transaction. If there
                  are sensitization problems on the easy paths, then bet on
                  either a bug in transaction flows or a design bug.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Instrumentation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Instrumentation plays a bigger role in transaction flow
                  testing than in unit path testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The information of the path taken for a given transaction must
                  be kept with that transaction and can be recorded by a central
                  transaction dispatcher or by the individual processing
                  modules.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In some systems, such traces are provided by the operating
                  systems or a running log.
                </p>

              The Dictionary object stores name/value pairs(referred to as the
              key and item respectively) in an array. The key is a unique

              Procedures are small logical components which breaks (splits) the

              Procedures can take its arguments, perform a series of operations

            <ul>
              <li>
                Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a
                communication network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Network topology can be used to define or describe the
                arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks,
                including command and control radio networks, industrial field
                busses and computer networks.
              </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and
                network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly
                two endpoints, it is called Linear Bus topology.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>It is cost effective</li>
              <li>
                Cable required is least compared to another network topology.

            <ul>
              <li>
                It is called Ring topology because it forms a ring as each
                computer is connected to another computer, with the last one
                connected to the first. In ring topology, each device have
                exactly two neighbors
              </li>
              <li>
                In ring topology, the transmission is unidirectional, but it can
                be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each
                Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Dual Ring Topology, two ring networks are formed, and data
                flow is in opposite direction in them. Also, if one ring fails,
                the second ring can act as a backup, to keep the network up.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by
                adding more nodes, as only the nodes having tokens can transmit
                data.

                others nodes are connected to the central node.
              </li>
              <li>Hub acts as a repeater for data flow.</li>

              The software design concept simply means the idea or principle
              behind the design. It describes how you plan to solve the problem
              of designing software, the logic, or thinking behind how you will
              design software.

                >&nbsp;<br />Abstraction simply means to hide the details to
                reduce complexity and increases efficiency or quality. Different
                levels of Abstraction are necessary and must be applied at each
                stage of the design process so that any error that is present
                can be removed to increase the efficiency of the software
                solution and to refine the software solution.

                  >[2 Mark]</span
                >&nbsp;<br />Modularity simply means dividing the system or
                project into smaller parts to reduce the complexity of the
                system or project. In the same way, modularity in design means
                subdividing a system into smaller parts so that these parts can
                be created independently and then use these parts in different
                systems to perform different functions. If the system contains
                fewer components then it would mean the system is complex which
                requires a lot of effort (cost) but if we are able to divide the
                system into components then the cost would be small.

                remove any impurities if present and increase the quality. The
                refinement concept of software design is actually a process of
                developing or presenting the software or system in a detailed
                manner that means to elaborate a system or software. Refinement
                is very necessary to find out any error if present and then to
                reduce it.

                information so that it cannot be accessed by an unwanted party.
                In software design, information hiding is achieved by designing
                the modules in a manner that the information gathered or
                contained in one module is hidden and can’t be accessed by any
                other modules.

              It focuses on the smallest unit of software design. In this, we
              test an individual unit or group of interrelated units. It is
              often done by the programmer by using sample input and observing
              its corresponding outputs.

            <p>
              The objective is to take unit tested components and build a
              program structure that has been dictated by design. Integration
              testing is testing in which a group of components is combined to
              produce output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Integration testing is of four types: (i) Top-down (ii) Bottom-up
              (iii) Sandwich (iv) Big-Bang

            <p>
              Every time a new module is added leads to changes in the program.
              This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works
              properly even after adding components to the complete program.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In school record suppose we have module staff, students and

            <p>Most widelly used cost estimation techniques(top down)</p>
            <p>
              Expert judgement relies on the experience background and business
              sense of one or more key people in an organisation mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: An expert might arrive at a cost estimate in a following
              manner,
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The goal is to estimate the requirements to develop a process
                controll system
              </li>
              <li>
                It is similar to one that was developed last year in 10 months
                at a cost of one million dollar
              </li>
              <li>It was not a respectible profit</li>
              <li>
                The new system has same control functions as the previous but
                25% more control activities. So the time and cost is increased
                by 25%
              </li>
              <li>
                Same computer and controlling devices and many of the same
                people are available to develop the new sysem therefore 20% of
                the estimate is reduced
              </li>
              <li>
                Reusing the low level code from the previous reduces the time
                and cost estimates by 25%
              </li>
              <li>
                This results in the estimation of 8,00,000$ & 8 Months
                development time
              </li>
              <li>
                With a small margin of safety added, it becomes 8,50,000 & 9
                Months development time

              This family of models was proposed by Boehm in 1981. The models
              have been widely accepted in practice. In the COCOMOs, the
              code-size S is given in thousand LOC (KLOC) and efforts is on
              person-month. COCOMO is actually a hierarchy of estimation models
              that address the following areas:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Application composition model:</strong> Used during the
              early stages of software engineering, when prototyping of user
              interfaces, consideration of software and system interaction,
              assessment of performance, and technology maturity are paramount.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Early design stage model:</strong> Used once requirements
              have stabilized and basic software architecture has been
              established.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Post-architecture-stage model:</strong> Used during the
              construction of the software.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Basic COCOMO:</span> This model uses
                  three sets of {a, b} depending only on the complexity of the
                  software.
                </p>
                <ol>

                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Intermediate & Detailed COCOMO:</span>
                  In the intermediate COCOMO, a nominal effort estimation is
                  obtained using the power function with three sets of {a, b},
                  with coefficient a being slightly different from that of the
                  basic COCOMO.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    For simple, well-understood applications, a = 3.2, b = 1.05;
                  </li>
                  <li>For more complex systems, a = 3.0, b = 1.15;</li>
                  <li>For embedded systems, a= 2.8, b = 1.20;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Then, fifteen Cost Factors with values ranging from 0.7 to
                  1.66 are determined. The overall impact factor 'M' is obtained
                  as the product of all individual factors, and the estimate is
                  obtained by multiplying 'M' to the nominal estimate
                </p>
                <p>
                  While both basic and intermediate COCOMOs estimate the
                  software cost at the system level, the detailed COCOMO works
                  on each sub-system separately and has an obvious advantage for
                  large systems that contain non-homogenous subsystems.

              functional as well as non-functional depending upon type of
              requirement. The interaction between different customers and
              contractor is done because its necessary to fully understand needs
              of customers.

              The goal of a feasibility study is to determine whether a proposed
              project is worth pursuing. The study examines two fundamental
              categories costs and potential benefits. A feasibility study
              should provide management with enough information to decide, they
              are

                Whether the final product will benefit its intended users?
              </li>
              <li>
                What are the alternatives among which a solution will be chosen?
              </li>
              <li>Is there a preferred alternative?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Feasibility study is divided into costs and benefits,</p>

              <span>Costs</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Costs are divided into up-front or one-time costs and ongoing
              costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Upfront/Onetime Costs</h4>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Almost all projects will entail similar up-front costs. The
              organization will often have to purchase additional hardware,
              software and communication equipment. These costs can be estimated
              with the help of vendors.
            </p>
            <h4>Ongoing Costs</h4>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Once the project is completed and the system installed, costs will
              arise from several areas,
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                New system might require additional personnel and supplies.

              <li>
                Additional training and support might be required to deal with
                employee turnover and system modification
              </li>
              <li>
                Software and hardware will have to be modified and replaced

            </h4>
            <p>
              Benefits are divided into cost savings, increased value and

                  <li>Benefits are even more difficult to estimate.</li>
                  <li>
                    Some benefits are tangible and can be measured with a degree
                    of accuracy.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many benefits are intangible and cannot be assigned specific
                    monetary values.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In a database project benefits can arise from improving
                    operation which leads to cost savings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Database projects can provide many benefits but the
                    organization will receive those benefits only if the project
                    is completed correctly, on time and within the specified
                    budgets.

              Database testing checks the integrity and consistency of data by
              verifying the schema, tables, triggers, etc., of the application’s
              database that is being tested. In Database testing, we create
              complex queries to perform the load or stress test on the database
              and verify the database’s responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              An issue in the database might cause a crash or leakage of data,
              we are aware of the importance of keeping the privacy of the
              user’s data. So, it is crucial to perform database testing to
              ensure data integrity, consistency, etc., are being maintained.
            </p>
            <p>
              By performing database testing we can guarantee the security and
              reliability of an application as it exposes the vulnerability in
              the database.
            </p>
            <h4>Benefits of Database Testing:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Database testing helps in ensuring the database’s efficiency,
                stability, performance, and security.
              </li>
              <li>
                During database testing, we can understand the behavior of
                complex transactions and how the system handles such queries.
              </li>
              <li>
                It makes sure that only valid data values and information are
                received and stored in the database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Database testing protects us from vulnerabilities like data
                loss, saves aborted transaction data, and doesn’t allow access
                to information for unauthorized users.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>
              Consider an application that captures the day-to-day transaction
              details for users and stores the details in the database. From
              database testing point of view, the following checks should be
              performed,
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The transactional information from the application should be
                stored in the database and it should provide correct information
                to the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information should not be lost when it is loaded to database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only completed transactions should be stored and all incomplete
                operations should be aborted by the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                Access authorization to database should be maintained. No
                unapproved or unauthorized access to user information should be
                provided.

            <h4>Client/Server</h4>
            <p>
              Client/server describes the relationship between two computer
              programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request
              from another program, the server, which fulfills the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to
              interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across
              different locations. The client/server model has become one of the
              central ideas of network computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Client-server computing is a software engineering technique often
              used within distributed computing that allows two independent

              Client-server system is mainly two different processors that
              exchange information on common server. Unlike peer to peer system
              there is one server that stores the information and gives it only
              when the client provides specific identification like username.

            <p>
              Functions such as email exchange, web access and database access,
              are built on the client-server model.

            <p>
              To check the bank account from computer, a client program in the
              computer forwards the request to a server program at the bank.
              That program may in turn forward the request to its own client
              program that sends a request to a database server at another bank
              computer to retrieve the account balance. The balance is returned
              back to the bank data client, which in turn serves it back to the
              client in the personal computer, which displays the information
              for us.

              The World Wide Web (abbreviated as WWW or W3, commonly known as
              the Web), is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed
              via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that
              may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia, and
              navigate between them via hyperlinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The World Wide Web was designed as a client/server system. The
              objective was to enable people to share information with their
              colleagues. The clients run browser software that receives and
              displays data files. The servers run web server software that
              answers requests, finds the appropriate files, and sends the
              required data.

              &bull;&nbsp;Cluster analysis or clustering is the assignment of a
              set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that

              &bull;&nbsp;Data partitioning is a technique to improve
              application performance or security by splitting tables across
              multiple locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Data partitioning is the process of logically or
              physically partitioning data into segments that are more easily
              maintained or accessed.
            </p>
            <h4>Horizontal Partitioning</h4>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Horizontal partitioning is often used to split data so
              that it can be stored in location where it will use the most. It
              involves putting
              <span class="underline">different rows into different tables</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Some of the rows (i.e. active data) will be stored in
              one location and other rows (i.e. inactive data) will be stored in
              a different location. The active data will be stored on high speed
              disk drives.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;The user does not need to know about the split because
              the DBMS automatically retrieve data from either location.
            </p>
            <h4>Vertical Partitioning</h4>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Vertical partitioning involves
              <span class="underline">creating tables with fewer columns</span>
              and using additional tables to store the remaining columns.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;In vertical partitioning active or frequently used
              columns of data are stored on a faster drive, while inactive or
              rarely used columns are moved to a cheaper and slower drives.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Overall performance will improve because the DBMS will
              be able to retrieve more of the smaller rows.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Vertical partitioning is useful for limiting the
              amount of data that need to read into memory.

            <p>
              The DBMS is preferred over the conventional file processing system
              due to the following advantages,
            </p>
            <h4 class="subject__sub-heading">
              <span>1.</span>
              <span>Minimal Data Redundancy:</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Redundancy means repitition or duplication of data. In DBMS, the
              data redundancy can be controlled or reduced but it is not removed
              completely. By controlling the data redundancy, you can save
              storage space.

            </h4>
            <p>
              The DBMS also has system to maintain data consistency with minimal
              effort.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Since data in database is stored in tables, any data in the
              database can be easily retrieved, combined and compared using the
              query system.

            </h4>
            <p>
              In DBMS, data can be shared by authorized users of the
              organization. The DBA manages the data and gives rights to users
              to access the data. Many users can be authorized to access the
              same set of information simultaneously.

            </h4>
            <p>
              The DBMS provides tools that can be used to develop application
              programs thereby reduces the cost and time for developing new
              applications.

            <p>A DBMS is evaluated based on the following components,</p>

              <li><p>Database Engine</p></li>
              <li><p>Data Dictionary</p></li>

              <li><p>Security and Other Utilities</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Database Engine</h4>
            <p>
              The database engine is the heart of the dbms. The engine is
              responsible for defining, storing and retrieving the data. It
              affects the performance (speed) and the ability to handle large
              problems (scalability). It is a stand-alone component that can be
              purchased and used as an independent software module.
              <span class="underline">Example: Microsoft Jet Engine</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Data Dictionary</h4>
            <p>
              The data dictionary holds the definition of all the tables. A data
              dictionary is a reserved space within a database which is used to
              store information about the database itself i.e. design
              information, user permissions etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Query Processor</h4>
            <p>
              It is the fundamental component of DBMS. It enables developers and
              users to store and retrieve data. All database operations can be
              run through the query language. Query language is processed by the
              query processor.
            </p>
            <h4>Report Writer</h4>
            <p>
              Report is a summarization of database data. It extracts
              information from one or more files and presents the information in
              a specified format.
