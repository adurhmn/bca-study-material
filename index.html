              The Dictionary object stores name/value pairs(referred to as the
              key and item respectively) in an array. The key is a unique
              identifier for the corresponding item and cannot be used for any
              other item in the same Dictionary object.

              The following code creates a Dictionary object called “cars”, adds
              some key/item pairs, retrieves the item value for the key 'b'
              using the Item property and then outputs the outputting string to

              Procedures are small logical components which breaks (splits) the
              program into a separate task. Procedures can be called inside of
              another procedure

              VBScript (Visual Basic Script) is developed by Microsoft with the
              intention of developing dynamic web pages. It is client-side
              scripting language like JavaScript. VBScript is a light version of
              Microsoft Visual Basic. The syntax of VBScript is very similar to
              that of Visual Basic. If you want your webpage to be more lively
              and interactive, then you can incorporate VBScript in your
              code.&nbsp;<span class="subject__mark-flag">[2 Mark]</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                VBScript is a lightweight scripting language, which has a
                lightning fast interpreter.
              </li>
              <li>
                VBScript, for the most part, is case insensitive. It has a very
                simple syntax, easy to learn and to implement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unlike C++ or Java, VBScript is an object-based scripting
                language and NOT an Object-Oriented Programming language.
              </li>
              <li>
                It uses Component Object Model (COM) in order to access the
                elements of the environment in which it is executing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Successful execution of VBScript can happen only if it is
                executed in Host Environment such as Internet Explorer (IE),
                Internet Information Services (IIS) and Windows Scripting Host
                (WSH).
              </li>
              <li>
                VBScript is also used for Network Administration, System
                Administration and for UFT Test Automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we already know Visual Basic (VB) or Visual Basic for
                Applications (VBA), VBScript will be very familiar.
              </li>
              <li>
                VBScript talks to host applications using Windows Script. With
                Windows Script, browsers and other host applications do not
                require special integration code for each scripting component.

            <h4>Definition:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a
                communication network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Network topology can be used to define or describe the
                arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks,
                including command and control radio networks, industrial field
                busses and computer networks.
              </li>
            </ul>

            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and
                network device is connected to single cable. When it has exactly
                two endpoints, it is called Linear Bus topology.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>It is cost effective</li>
              <li>
                Cable required is least compared to another network topology.
              </li>
              <li>It is easy to understand.</li>

            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It is called Ring topology because it forms a ring as each
                computer is connected to another computer, with the last one
                connected to the first. In ring topology, each device have
                exactly two neighbors
              </li>
              <li>
                In ring topology, the transmission is unidirectional, but it can
                be made bidirectional by having 2 connections between each
                Network Node, it is called Dual Ring Topology.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Dual Ring Topology, two ring networks are formed, and data
                flow is in opposite direction in them. Also, if one ring fails,
                the second ring can act as a backup, to keep the network up.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by
                adding more nodes, as only the nodes having tokens can transmit
                data.
              </li>
              <li>Cheap to install and expand.</li>

                In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a
                single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all
                others nodes are connected to the central node.
              </li>
              <li>Hub acts as a repeater for data flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Fast performance with few nodes and low network traffic.</li>
              <li>Hub can be upgraded easily.</li>
              <li>Easy to troubleshoot.</li>
              <li>Easy to setup and modify.</li>
              <li>
                Only that node is affected which has failed, rest of the nodes
                can work smoothly.

                department ring topology is used and in another star topology is
                used, connecting these topologies will result in Hybrid Topology

            <ol>
              <li>
                Testing is the process using which we find errors and bugs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing starts with known conditions, uses predefined procedures
                and has predictable outcomes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing can, and should be planned, designed and scheduled
              </li>
              <li>
                One does not need any design knowledge to perform testing.
              </li>
              <li>Both insiders and outsiders can perform testing.</li>
              <li>Much of test execution and design can be automated</li>
              <li>
                Testing is a stage of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).
              </li>
              <li>
                This process can begin after we have completed writing the code.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Debugging</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Debugging is the process using which we correct the bugs that we
                found during the testing process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Debugging starts from possibly unknown initial conditions and
                the end cannot be predicted except statistically
              </li>
              <li>
                Procedure and duration of debugging cannot be so constrained
              </li>
              <li>Debugging is impossible without detailed design knowledge</li>
              <li>Debugging must be done by an insider</li>
              <li>Automated debugging is still a dream</li>
              <li>
                Debugging is not at all an aspect of the SDLC. It rather occurs
                as a consequence of the process of testing.
              </li>
              <li>
                This process can begin after the execution of the test case and
                the identification of errors.

            <h4>Phase 1:&nbsp;Static Testing (Requirements Testing)</h4>
            <p>
              During static testing, developers work to avoid potential problems
              that might arise later. Without executing the code, they perform
              manual or automated reviews of the supporting documents for the
              software, such as requirement specifications, looking for any
              potential ambiguities, errors or redundancies. The goal is to
              preempt defects before introducing them to the software system.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 2:&nbsp;Unit Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[2 Mark] [5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The next phase of software testing is unit testing. Unit Testing
              is a type of software testing where individual units or components
              of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each
              unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Tests isolate
              a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an
              individual function, method, procedure, module, or object. Unit
              testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed
              by the developers during the development (coding phase) of an
              application.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 3:&nbsp;Integration Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Integration Testing is as a type of testing where software modules
              are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software
              project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different
              programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose
              defects in the interaction between these software modules when
              they are integrated. Through integration testing, the developers
              can determine the overall efficiency of the units as they run
              together. This phase is important because the program's overall
              functionality relies on the units operating simultaneously as a
              complete system, not as isolated procedures.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Phase 4:&nbsp;System Testing&nbsp;
              <span class="subject__mark-flag">[5 Mark]</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              In the system testing phase, the software undergoes its first test
              as a complete, integrated application to determine how well it
              carries out its purpose. For this, the developers pass the
              software to independent testers who had no involvement in its
              development in order to ensure that the testing results stem from
              impartial evaluations. System testing is vital because it ensures
              that the software meets the requirements as determined by the
              client.
            </p>
            <h4>Phase 5:&nbsp;Acceptance Testing (User Acceptance Testing)</h4>
            <p>
              Acceptance testing is the last phase of software testing. Its
              purpose is to evaluate the software's readiness for release and
              practical use. Testers may perform acceptance testing alongside
              individuals who represent the software's target audience.
              Acceptance testing aims to show whether the software meets the
              needs of its intended users and that any changes the software
              experienced during development are appropriate for use. Once the
              software passes acceptance testing, it moves on to production.

              •&nbsp;A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or
              produce invalid output. The problem is caused by insufficient or
              erroneous logic. A bug can be an error, mistake, defect, or fault,
              which may cause failure or deviation from expected results.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Software bugs should be caught during the testing phase of
              the software development life cycle, but some can go undetected
              until after deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Debugging is a process of finding out where something went
              wrong and correcting the code to eliminate the errors or bugs that
              cause unexpected results. A software debugging system can provide
              tools for finding errors or bugs in programs and correcting
              them.&nbsp;<span class="subject__mark-flag">[2 Mark]</span>
            </p>

            <h4>Types of bugs:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h4>Logic bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the types of coding errors that can cause the program
                  to output incorrectly or even freeze or crash. For example, an
                  infinite loop would cause the program to repeat the sequence
                  of actions indefinitely until it crashes or halts due to
                  external intervention, such as the program closing or a power
                  outage.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Calculation errors</h4>
                <p>
                  Calculation errors may occur due to bad logic, an incorrect
                  formula, a data type mismatch or a coding error. Calculation
                  errors can be serious. For example, a calculation error in a
                  banking system can result in loss of money. Fixing the
                  calculation error is typically just a matter of math.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Functional Errors</h4>
                <p>
                  This type of error occurs whenever software does not behave as
                  intended. For example, a Login button doesn't allow users to
                  login, an Add to cart button that doesn't update the cart,
                  etc. So basically, any component in an app or website that
                  doesn't function as intended is a functional bug.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Security bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  Security errors are perhaps one of the most severe defects,
                  making the project vulnerable. This type of bugs opens the
                  software, company, and customers to a potential intense
                  attack.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Syntax errors</h4>
                <p>
                  Such errors occur in the program's source code and prevent the
                  program from compiling correctly. This type of defect is
                  widespread and usually occurs when there are one or more
                  missing or incorrect characters in the code. For example,
                  missing one parenthesis can cause a syntax error.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Compatibility errors</h4>
                <p>
                  These software bugs occur when an application does not run
                  consistently across different hardware, operating systems, and
                  browsers.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Performance bugs</h4>
                <p>
                  This is a type of software bug, related to speed, stability,
                  response time, and software resource consumption. Such defects
                  are discovered during the performance testing phase.
                </p>
              </li>
              <!-- <li>
                <h4>Usability defects</h4>
                <p>
                  A usability defect makes the software difficult or
                  inconvenient, such as a complex registration form. This type
                  of error prevents the user from using the software to its full
                  potential. Software engineers and UX designers must review
                  their software against the Web Content Accessibility
                  Guidelines and other usability requirements to detect such
                  errors.

              <li>
                <h4>Communication errors</h4>
                <p>
                  This type of error arises when a communication breakdown
                  occurs between software and the end-user. For example. a
                  communication bug is bound to occur during the software use if
                  it contains undocumented features. For seamless and effective
                  communication between both parties, software should be easy to
                  use and provide all necessary instructions and recommendations
                  for users to interact with a program.

              •&nbsp;Model-based testing is a software testing technique in
              which the test cases are derived from a model that describes the
              functional aspects of the system under test. It makes use of a
              model to generate tests that includes both offline and online
              testing. Model based testing is the modern approach to software
              testing.

            <p>
              •&nbsp;A model is a description of a system's behavior. Behavior
              can be described in terms of input sequences, actions, conditions,

                <p>
                  This model helps testers to assess the result depending on the
                  input selected. There can be various combinations of the
                  inputs which result in a corresponding state of the system.
                  The system will have a specific state and current state which
                  is governed by a set of inputs given from the testers.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A transaction is a unit of work seen from a system user's
                  point of view.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A transaction consists of a sequence of operations, some of
                  which are performed by a system, persons or devices that are
                  outside of the system
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Transaction flows are indispensable for specifying
                  requirements of complicated systems, especially online
                  systems.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A big system such as an air traffic control or airline
                  reservation system, has not hundreds, but thousands of
                  different transaction flows.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
              A transaction for an online information retrieval system might
              consist of the following steps or tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Accept input (tentative birth)</p></li>

                  Complicated systems that process a lot of different,
                  complicated transactions should have explicit representations
                  of the transactions flows, or the equivalent.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Transaction flows are like control flow graphs, and
                  consequently we should expect to have them in increasing
                  levels of detail.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The system's design documentation should contain an overview
                  section that details the main transaction flows.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Detailed transaction flows are a mandatory prerequisite to the
                  rational design of a system's functional testing.

              Transaction flow is sequence of steps for a system to be tested.
              The transaction flow begins at the preliminary design and
              continues as the project progresses. The following testing
              strategies has been taken.
            </p>
            <h4>Inspections, Reviews and Walkthroughs:</h4>
            <p>
              Transaction flows are natural agenda for system reviews or
              inspections. In conducting the walkthroughs, you should:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discuss enough transaction types to account for 98%-99% of the
                  transaction the system is expected to process.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Discuss paths through flows in functional rather than
                  technical terms.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Ask the designers to relate every flow to the specification
                  and to show how that transaction, directly or indirectly,
                  follows from the requirements.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Make transaction flow testing the cornerstone of system
                  functional testing just as path testing is the cornerstone of
                  unit testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select additional flow paths for loops, extreme values, and
                  domain boundaries.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Design more test cases to validate all births and deaths.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Publish and distribute the selected test paths through the
                  transaction flows as early as possible so that they will exert
                  the maximum beneficial effect on the project.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Selection:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select a set of covering paths (c1+c2) using the analogous
                  criteria that were used for structural path testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Select a covering set of paths based on functionally sensible
                  transactions, as you would for control flow graphs.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Try to find the most tortuous, longest, strangest path from
                  the entry to the exit of the transaction flow.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Sensitization:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Most of the normal paths are very easy to sensitize-80% - 95%
                  transaction flow coverage (c1+c2) is usually easy to achieve.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The remaining small percentage is often very difficult.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Sensitization is the act of defining the transaction. If there
                  are sensitization problems on the easy paths, then bet on
                  either a bug in transaction flows or a design bug.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Path Instrumentation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Instrumentation plays a bigger role in transaction flow
                  testing than in unit path testing.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The information of the path taken for a given transaction must
                  be kept with that transaction and can be recorded by a central
                  transaction dispatcher or by the individual processing
                  modules.
                </p>

              •&nbsp;Data-flow testing is a white box testing technique that can
              be used to detect improper use of data values due to coding errors
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;The primary purpose of dynamic data-flow testing is to
              uncover possible bugs in data usage during the execution of the
              code. To achieve this, test cases are created which trace every
              definition to each of its use and every use is traced to each of
              its definition. Various strategies are employed for the creation
              of the test cases.

              The all-du-paths (ADUP) strategy is that every du path from every

              In tracing a path or path segment through a flow graph, you
              traverse a succession of link names. The name of the path or path
              segment that corresponds to those links is expressed naturally by
              concatenating those link names. For example, if you traverse links
              a, b, c and d along some path, the name for that path segment is
              abcd. This path name is also called a
              <span class="underline">Path Product</span>. The below images
              contains more examples.

                <p>
                  The name of a path that consists of two successive path
                  segments is conveniently expressed by the concatenation or
                  Path Product of the segment names.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if X and Y are defined as X = abcde, Y = fghij,
                  then the path corresponding to X followed by Y is denoted by
                  XY = abcdefghij. Similarly, YX = fghijabcde, aX = aabcde, Xa =
                  abcdea, XaX = abcdeaabcde
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If X and Y represent sets of paths or path expressions, their
                  product represents the set of paths that can be obtained by
                  following every element of X by any element of Y in all
                  possible ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if X and Y are defined as X = abc + def + ghi, Y
                  = uvw + z. Then XY = abcuvw + defuvw + ghiuvw + abcz + defz +
                  ghiz

                <p>
                  If a link or segment name is repeated, that fact is denoted by
                  an exponent. The exponent's value denotes the number of
                  repetitions:

              •&nbsp;The above figure is an example of a routine that, for the
              (unfortunately) chosen input value (X = 16), yields the same
              outcome (Y = 2) no matter which case we select. Therefore, the
              tests chosen this way will not tell us whether we have achieved
              coverage. For example, the five cases could be totally jumbled and
              still the outcome would be the same. Path Instrumentation is what
              we have to do to confirm that the outcome was achieved by the
              intended path.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Path Instrumentation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Interpretive Trace Program:</h4>
                <p>
                  An interpretive trace program is one that executes every
                  statement in order and records the intermediate values of all
                  calculations, the statement labels traversed etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we run the tested routine under a trace, then we have all
                  the information we need to confirm the outcome and,
                  furthermore, to confirm that it was achieved by the intended
                  path.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Link Marker or Traversal Marker</h4>
                <p>
                  Name every link by a lower case letter. Instrument the links
                  so that the link's name is recorded when the link is executed.
                  The succession of letters produced in going from the routine's
                  entry to its exit should exactly correspond to the path name.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h4>Link Counter:</h4>
                <p>
                  Instead of a unique link name to be pushed into a string when
                  the link is traversed, we simply increment a link counter. We
                  now confirm that the path length is as expected.

              •&nbsp;In production of consumer goods and other products, every
              manufacturing stage is subjected to quality control and testing
              from start to final stage. If flaws are discovered at any stage,
              the product is either discarded or cycled back for rework and
              correction.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Productivity is measured by sum of the costs of the

              testing.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;There is a trade-off between quality assurance costs and
              manufacturing costs: If sufficient time is not spent in quality
              assurance, the reject rate will be high and so will be the net
              cost. If inspection is good and all errors are caught as they
              occur, inspection costs will dominate, and again the net cost will
              suffer.

              •&nbsp;Testing and Quality assurance costs for manufactured items
              can be as low as 2% in consumer products or as high as 80% in
              software products for space-ships, nuclear reactors, and
              aircrafts, where failures threaten life.

              designing tests that discover them, and the cost of running those
              tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Testing and Test Design are parts of quality assurance and

            Top Down Integration testing which is also known as Incremental
            integration testing. In this Top Down approach the higher level
            modules are tested first after higher level modules the lower level
            modules are tested. Then these modules undergo for integration
            accordingly. Here the higher level modules refers to main module and
            lower level modules refers to submodules. This approach uses Stubs
            which are mainly used to simulate the submodule, if the invoked
            submodule is not developed this Stub works as a momentary
            replacement.

              Smoke Testing is a software testing process that determines
              whether the deployed software build is stable or not. Smoke
              testing is a confirmation for QA team to proceed with further
              software testing. It consists of a minimal set of tests run on
              each build to test software functionalities. Smoke testing is also
              known as “Build Verification Testing” or “Confidence Testing.

              Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but
              not limited to, advertisements, art, education, entertainment,
              engineering, medicine, mathematics, scientific research etc. A few
              application areas of multimedia are listed below:
            </p>
            <h4>Entertainment</h4>
            <p>
              One of the main and widespread applications of multimedia can be
              seen in the entertainment Industry. Movies, ADs, Short clips are
              now being created using special effects and animations, like VFX.
              Multimedia is also used for gaming purposes which are distributed
              online or through CDs. These games also integrated various
              multimedia features.
            </p>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>
              Multimedia is used in education sector to create interactive
              educational materials, like books, PDF’s, videos, PowerPoint
              Presentation, etc along with one touch access to websites like
              Wikipedia and encyclopedia. Through virtual classrooms, teachers
              and students can avail the opportunity to learn, interact and
              exchange informative ideas without stepping outside and sit for
              hours inside a classroom. On top of everything, computer-based
              competitive as well as scholastics exams are being conducted
              globally only via the use of multimedia.
            </p>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>
              With the emergence of internet and its rapid spread across the
              world, traditional types of communication have become obsolete.
              Online video calling has become the new face of communication.
              Video platforms like Skype, Google Meet allow video chats that can
              happen between friends or can be used for conducting meetings
              between different heads of countries. Communication has been
              moulded as a matter of fraction of seconds, hence, now you can
              easily convey anything with just a few clicks. This has turned out
              to be a boon in situations of emergency, thus, it is known as one
              of the most beneficial applications of multimedia.
            </p>
            <h4>Medicine</h4>
            <p>
              Multimedia is increasingly used by doctors to get trained by
              simply watching a surgery being done on a virtual platform.
              Simulation technology is used to develop human anatomy and study
              how it gets affected by different illnesses and then accordingly
              develop medicines and other remedial measures.
            </p>
            <h4>Commerce (E-Commerce)</h4>
            <p>
              Online business has effectively replaced traditional ways of
              buying and selling. Simply, scrolling through online shopping
              sites like Amazon we see how text, pictures, and videos have been
              blended into making an appealing user interface. Through use of
              multimedia various companies offer interesting details of products
              to the prospective consumer who, simply through, a mobile phone
              buys and compares products online to check its suitability and
              price variances.

              Most multimedia and web projects must be undertaken in stages.
              Some stages should be completed before other stages begin, and
              some stages may be skipped or combined. Here are the four basic
              stages in a multimedia project:

            <p>
              A project always begins with an idea or a need that you then
              refine by outlining its messages and objectives. Before starting
              to develop the multimedia project, it is necessary to plan what
              writing skills, graphic art, music, video, and other multimedia
              skills will be required. It is also necessary to estimate the time
              needed to prepare all elements of multimedia and prepare a budget
              accordingly. After preparing a budget, a prototype of the concept
              can be developed to demonstrate whether or not your idea is
              feasible.

              The final stage of the multimedia application development is to
              pack the project and deliver the complete project to the end-user.
              This stage has several steps such as:

              To transmit information to multimedia, we use various types of
              input devices. A few important input devices are explained below,
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Keyboard:</strong><br />
              The keyboard is a basic input device that is used to enter data
              into a computer or any other electronic device by pressing keys.
              It has different sets of keys for letters, numbers, characters,
              and functions. Keyboards are connected to a computer through USB
              or a Bluetooth device for wireless communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Mouse:</strong><br />
              The mouse is a hand-held input device which is used to move cursor
              or pointer across the screen. It is designed to be used on a flat
              surface and generally has left and right button and a scroll wheel
              between them. Laptop computers come with a touchpad that works as
              a mouse. It lets you control the movement of cursor or pointer by
              moving your finger over the touchpad. Some mouse comes with
              integrated features such as extra buttons to perform different
              actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Scanner:</strong><br />
              The scanner uses the pictures and pages of text as input. It scans
              the picture or a document. The scanned picture or document then
              converted into a digital format or file and is displayed on the
              screen as an output. It uses optical character recognition
              techniques to convert images into digital ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Microphone:</strong><br />
              The microphone is a computer input device that is used to input
              the sound. It receives the sound vibrations and converts them into
              audio signals or sends to a recording medium. The audio signals
              are converted into digital data and stored in the computer. The
              microphone also enables the user to telecommunicate with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Digital Camera:</strong><br />It is a digital device as it
              captures images and records videos digitally and then stores them
              on a memory card. It is provided with an image sensor chip to
              capture images, as opposed to film used by traditional cameras.
              Besides this, a camera that is connected to your computer can also
              be called a digital camera.

              <strong>Computer Literacy: </strong><br />
              Computer literacy refers to the skills one has at their disposal
              while using computer-based technology. Multimedia artists work
              almost entirely on the computer, using a variety of software
              programs for research and design purposes. Familiarity with
              graphic design, photo correction, and video editing, all of which
              are done using a computer, are important components for completing
              many multimedia projects.

            <p>
              <strong>Design: </strong><br />
              Along with creativity, having strong design skills are important
              for multimedia artists to posses. Design skills can include
              manipulation of colors and fonts, composing background music or
              scripting a podcast, among many others.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Communication: </strong><br />
              Like many other industries, multimedia design requires strong
              communication amongst clients, artists and management. Multimedia
              artists might correspond with their clients to ensure that they
              are meeting all of their standards. They are also able to
              communicate with clients and supervisors to negotiate and discuss
              payment, deadlines or any other element vital to the completion of
              a creative project.

              viewed individually, for example the pages of a book or file cards
              in card file. You can jump from page to page because all pages can
              be interrelated. In the authoring system you can organize pages or
              cards in the sequences manner. Every page of the book may contain
              many media elements like sounds, videos and animations.

              Icon-based tools give a visual programming approach to organizing
              and presenting multimedia. First you build a structure or
              flowchart of events, tasks and decisions by dragging appropriate
              icons from a library. Each icon does a specific task, for example-
              plays a sound, open an image etc. The flowchart graphically
              displays the project's logic. When the structure is built you can
              add your content text, graphics, animation, video movies and
              sounds. A nontechnical multimedia author can also build
              sophisticated applications without scripting using icon based
              authoring tools. Some examples of icon based tools are:
            </p>

              Time based authoring tools allow the designer to arrange various
              elements and events of the multimedia project along a well defined
              time line. By time line, we simply mean the passage of time. As
              the time advances from starting point of the project, the events
              begin to occur, one after another. The events may include media
              files playback as well as transition from one portion of the
              project to another. The speed at which these transitions occur can
              also be accurately controlled. These tools are best to use for
              those projects, wherein the information flow can be directed from
              beginning to end much like the movies. Some example of Time based

              •&nbsp;Object oriented authoring tools support environment based
              on object. Each object has the following two characteristics:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>State or Attributes: </strong>The state or attributes
                refers to the built in characteristics of an object. For
                example, a color T.V might have the following attributes:
                color-receiver, volume-control, picture-control etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Behaviour or Operations: </strong>The behavior or
                operations of an object refers to its action. For example, a T.V
                can behave in any of the following manner at a given point of
                time: switched on, switched off, display picture, display sound,
                etc.

            <p>
              •&nbsp;In these systems, multimedia elements events are often
              treated as objects that live in a hierarchical order of parent and
              child relationships. These objects use messages passed among them
              to do things according to the properties assigned to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;For example, a video object will likely have a duration
              property i.e how long the video plays and a source property that
              has the location of the video file. This video object will likely
              accept commands from the system such as play and stop. Some

              Audio format defines the quality and loss of audio data. Based on
              application different type of audio format are used. Audio formats
              are broadly divided into three parts:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Lossy Compressed format</li>
              <li>Lossless Compressed Format</li>
              <li>Uncompressed Format</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Lossy Compressed format</h4>
            <p>
              It is a form of compression that loses data during the compression
              process. But difference in quality is not noticeable to hear.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>MP3: </strong>It stands for MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3. It is
                most popular audio format for music files. Main aim of MP3 is to
                remove all those sounds which not hearable or less noticeable by
                humans ears. Hence making size of music file small. MP3 is like
                universal format which is compatible almost every device.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AAC: </strong> It stands for Advanced Audio Coding. The
                compression algorithm used by AAC is much more complex and
                advanced than MP3, so when compared a particular audio file in
                MP3 and AAC formats at the same bitrate, the AAC one will
                generally have better sound quality.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Lossless Compressed format</h4>
            <p>
              This method reduces file size without any loss in quality. But is
              not as good as lossy compression as the size of file compressed to
              lossy compression is 2 and 3 times more.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>FLAC: </strong>It stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec.
                It can compress a source file by up to 50% without losing data.
                It is most popular in its category and is open-source.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ALAC: </strong>It stands for Apple Lossless Audio Codec.
                It was developed by Apple.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Uncompressed format</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>PCM: </strong> It stands for Pulse-Code Modulation. It
                represents raw analog audio signals in digital form. To convert
                analog signal into digital signal it has to be recorded at a
                particular interval. Hence it has sampling rate and bit rate
                (bits used to represent each sample). It is an exact
                representation of the analog sound and do not involve
                compression. It is the most common audio format used in CDs and
                DVDs
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>WAV: </strong> It stands for Waveform Audio File Format.
                It is just a Windows container (wrapper) for audio formats. That
                means that a WAV file can contain compressed audio. Most WAV
                files contain uncompressed audio in PCM format. It is compatible
                with both Windows and Mac.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AIFF: </strong>It stands for Audio Interchange File
                Format. Like WAV files, AIFF files can contain multiple kinds of
                audio. It contain uncompressed audio in PCM format. It is just a
                wrapper for the PCM encoding. It is compatible with both Windows
                and Mac.

              Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) is a “lossy” format
              meaning that the image is compressed to reduce the file size. The
              compression does create a loss in quality but this loss is
              generally not noticeable. JPEG files are very common on the
              Internet and JPEG is a popular format for digital cameras - making

              graphics.They can be animated and are limited to only 256 colors.
              They can allow for transparency. GIF files are typically small is

              video codec encodes and compresses the video while the audio codec
              does the same with sound.

            <p>
              <strong>MP4</strong><br />
              MPEG-4 Part 14 or MP4 is one of the earliest digital video file
              formats introduced in 2001. Most digital platforms and devices
              support MP4. An MP4 format can store audio files, video files,
              still images, and text. MP4 provides high quality video while
              maintaining relatively small file sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>MOV</strong><br />
              MOV was designed by Apple to support the QuickTime player. MOV
              files contain videos, audio, subtitles, timecodes and other media
              types. Since it is a very high-quality video format, MOV files
              take significantly more memory space on a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WMV</strong><br />
              The Windows Media Viewer (WMV) video format was designed by
              Microsoft and is widely used in Windows media players. WMV format
              provides small file sizes with better compression than MP4. That
              is why it's popular for online video streaming.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>AVI</strong><br />
              Audio Video Interleave (AVI) works with nearly every web browser
              on Windows, Mac, and Linux machines. AVI offers the highest
              quality but also the largest file sizes. It is supported by
              YouTube and works well for TV viewing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>FLV, F4V, and SWF</strong><br />
              They are flash video formats designed for Flash Player, but
              they're commonly used to stream video online since they have a
              relatively small size which makes them easy to download.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WebM</strong><br />
              WebM is an open-source video format developed with the current and
              future state of the Internet in mind. WebM is intended for use
              with HTML5. The video codecs of WebM require very little computer
              power to compress and unzip the files. The aim of this design is
              to enable online video streaming on almost any device, such as
              tablets, desktop, smartphones or devices like smart TV.

              Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a standard protocol
              for the interchange of musical information between musical
              instruments, synthesizers and computers. MIDI files allow music
              and sound synthesizers from different manufacturers to communicate
              with each other by sending messages along cables connected to the
              devices.
            </p>
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;MIDI does not record analog or digital sound waves. It
              encodes keyboard functions, which includes the start of a note,
              its pitch, length, volume and musical attributes, such as vibrato.
              As a result, MIDI files take up considerably less space than
              digitized sound files.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Since the advent of the General MIDI standard for musical
              instruments, MIDI has been widely used for music backgrounds in
              multimedia applications due to its space-saving feature. It is
              MIDI technology you might be hearing as the latest mobile ring
              tone or on a thrill ride or attraction at a theme park.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;MIDI's small storage requirement makes it very desirable as
              a musical sound source for multimedia applications compared to
              digitizing actual music. For example, a three-minute MIDI file may
              take only 20 to 30K, whereas a WAV file (digital audio) could
              consume up to several megabytes depending on sound quality.

              •&nbsp;The Use-case model is defined as a model which is used to
              show how users interact with the system in order to solve a
              problem. As such, the use case model defines the user's objective,
              the interactions between the system and the user, and the system's
              behavior required to meet these objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;We use a use-case diagram to graphically portray a subset
              of the model in order to make the communication simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;The use-case model acts as an integrated thread in the
              development of the entire system. The use-case model is used like
              the main specification of the system functional requirements as
              the basis for design and analysis, as the basis for user
              documentation, as the basis of defining test cases, and as an
              input to iteration planning.

            <h4>Components of Basic Model</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Actor: </strong>Usually, actors are people involved
                  with the system defined on the basis of their roles. An actor
                  can be anything such as human or another external system.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Use Case: </strong>The use case defines how actors use
                  a system to accomplish a specific objective. The use cases are
                  generally introduced by the user to meet the objectives of the
                  activities and variants involved in the achievement of the
                  goal.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Associations: </strong>
                  Associations are another component of the basic model. It is
                  used to define the associations among actors and use cases
                  they contribute in. This association is called
                  communicates-association.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Subject: </strong>The subject component is used to
                  represent the boundary of the system of interest.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Use-Case Package: </strong>We use the model component
                  in order to structure the use case model to make simpler the
                  analysis, planning, navigation, and communication.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Generalizations: </strong>
                  Generalizations mean the association between the actors in
                  order to help re-use of common properties.
                </p>
              </li>

                  <strong>Dependencies: </strong>
                  In UML, various types of dependencies are defined between use
                  cases. In particular, &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; and
                  &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt;. We use &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;
                  dependency to comprise shared behavior from an included use
                  case into a base use case to use common behavior. We use
                  &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; dependency to include optional behavior
                  from an extended use-case into an extended use case.
                </p>
              </li>

              •&nbsp;Axiom is a fundamental truth that is always observed to be
              valid and for which there is no counterexample or exception. They
              cannot be proven or derived.
            </p>
            <p>•&nbsp;Suh's design axioms to OOD :</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Axiom 1: (The Independent Axiom)</strong><br />This
                  Axiom maintains the independence of components. It states
                  that, during the design process, as we go from requirement and
                  use - case to a system component, each component must satisfy
                  that requirement, without affecting other requirements

                <p>
                  <strong>Axiom 2: (The Information Axiom)</strong><br />
                  This axiom is concerned with simplicity. The goal is to
                  minimize the information content of the design. In
                  object-oriented system, to minimize complexity use inheritance
                  and the system's built in classes and add as little as
                  possible to what already is there.

            <p>
              •&nbsp;To maximize cohesiveness (interconnection) among objects
              and software components to improve coupling (combination,
              pairing), because only a minimal amount of essential information
              should be passed between components.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Abstraction leads to simplicity and straight- forwardness
              and, at the same time, increases class versatility (flexibility,
              resourcefulness, usefulness).
            </p>
            <h4>Five characteristics of bad design:</h4>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;If it looks messy (confused, disorder), then it's probably
              a bad design.
            </p>
            <p>•&nbsp;If it is too complex, then it's probably a bad design.</p>
            <p>•&nbsp;If it is too big, then it's probably a bad design.</p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;If people don't like it, then it's probably a bad design.
            </p>
            <p>•&nbsp;If it doesn't work, then it's probably a bad design.</p>
            <h4>Good Design Practices</h4>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Apply design axioms to avoid common design problems and
              pitfalls.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Much better to have a large set of simple classes than a
              few large, complex classes.

                <strong>Error-based testing</strong> techniques search a given
                class's method for particular clues of interests, then describe
                how these clues should be tested. E.g: Boundary condition
                testing
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scenario-based testing</strong> also called usage-based
                testing, concentrates on capturing use-cases. Then it traces
                user's task, performing them with their variants as tests. It
                can identify interaction bugs. These are more complex tests tend
                to exercise multiple subsystems in a single test covering higher
                visibility system interaction bugs

                <strong>Smoke Testing</strong> is a software testing process
                that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or
                not. Smoke testing is a confirmation for QA team to proceed with
                further software testing. It consists of a minimal set of tests
                run on each build to test software functionalities. Smoke
                testing is also known as “Build Verification Testing” or
                “Confidence Testing.

                <strong>Performance Testing</strong> is a software testing
                process used for testing the speed, response time, stability,
                reliability, scalability and resource usage of a software
                application under particular workload. The main purpose of
                performance testing is to identify and eliminate the performance
                bottlenecks in the software application.

                <strong>Stress Testing</strong> is a type of software testing
                that verifies stability & reliability of software application.
                The goal of Stress testing is measuring software on its
                robustness and error handling capabilities under extremely heavy
                load conditions and ensuring that software doesn't crash under
                crunch situations. It even tests beyond normal operating points
                and evaluates how software works under extreme conditions.

              functionalities of software applications are tested without having
              knowledge of internal code structure, implementation details and
              internal paths. Black Box Testing mainly focuses on input and
              output of software applications and it is entirely based on
              software requirements and specifications. It is also known as
              Behavioral Testing.

            <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units
              or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate
              that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit
              Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit
              may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or
              object. Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is
              usually performed by the developers during the development (coding
              phase) of an application.
            </p>
            <h4>Integration Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Integration Testing is as a type of testing where software modules
              are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software
              project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different
              programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose
              defects in the interaction between these software modules when
              they are integrated.
            </p>
            <h4>Top Down Integration Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Top Down Integration testing which is also known as Incremental
              integration testing. In this Top Down approach the higher level
              modules are tested first after higher level modules the lower
              level modules are tested. Then these modules undergo for
              integration accordingly. Here the higher level modules refers to
              main module and lower level modules refers to submodules. This
              approach uses Stubs which are mainly used to simulate the
              submodule, if the invoked submodule is not developed this Stub
              works as a momentary replacement.
            </p>
            <h4>Bottom Up Integration Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Bottom Up Integration testing is another approach of Integration
              testing. In this Bottom Up approach the lower level modules are
              tested first after lower level modules the higher level modules
              are tested. Then these modules undergo for integration
              accordingly. Here the lower level modules refers to submodules and
              higher level modules refers to main modules. This approach uses
              test drivers which are mainly used to initiate and pass the
              required data to the sub modules means from higher level module to
              lower level module if required.

              •&nbsp;Usablity is composed of effectiveness, efficiency, and
              satisfaction with which a specified set of users can achieve a
              specified set of tasks in particular environments. To achieve
              better usability we should,

            </ul>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Usability testing measures the ease of use as well as the
              degree of comfort and satisfaction users have with the software.
              Products with poor usability can be difficult to learn,
              complicated to operate, misused or not used at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Usability is one of the most crucial factors in the design
              and development of a product, especially the user interface.
              Therefore, usability testing must be a key part of the UI design
              process.

            <p>
              •&nbsp;The usability testing should include all of a software's
              components.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Usability testing need not be very expensive or elaborate.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;All tests need not involve many subjects. Typically, quick,
              iterative tests with small, well - targeted sample of 6 - 10
              participants can identify 80 - 90 percent of most design problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;The test participants should be novices or should be at
              intermediate level.

            <h4>Test Case Design Techniques</h4>
            <p>
              An efficient test case design technique is necessary to improve
              the quality of the software testing process. The test case design
              techniques are broadly classified into three major categories:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Specification-Based (Black Box Techniques): </strong
                >This type of techniques can be used to design test cases in a
                systematic format. These use external features of the software
                such as technical specifications, design, client's requirements,
                and more, to derive test cases. With this type of test case
                design techniques, testers can develop test cases that save
                testing time and allow full test coverage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Structure-Based (White Box Techniques): </strong> These
                techniques design test cases based on the internal structure of
                the software program and code. Developers go into minute details
                of the developed code and test them one by one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Experienced-Based Techniques: </strong>These techniques
                are highly dependent on tester's experience to understand the
                most important areas of the software. They are based on the
                skills, knowledge, and expertise of the people involved.

            <p>The impacts are as follows</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some types of errors could become less plausible.</li>
              <li>Some types of errors could become more plausible.</li>
              <li>Some new types of errors might appear.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Reusability of tests: </strong>Marick says that the
              simpler is a test, the more likely it is to be reusable in
              sub-classes. Simple tests find only faults. Complex tests find
              faults and also stumble across others.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Impact of Inheritance in Testing: </strong>If designers do
              not follow OOD guidelines especially, if test is done
              incrementally, it will lead with objects that are extremely hard
              to debug and maintain
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, the concept of inheritance opens various issues e.g.,
              if changes are made to a parent class or superclass, in a larger
              system of a class it will be difficult to test subclasses
              individually and isolate the error to one class.

              functionality to model real world objects. Each object has
              attributes (data) and method (function). Objects are grouped in to
              classes and objects are responsible for it. A chart object is

            <p>
              •&nbsp;The basic software development life cycle consists of
              analysis, design, implementation, testing and refinement. Its main
              aim is to transform users' needs into a software solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;The development is a process of change, refinement,
              transformation or addition to the existing product. The software
              development process can be viewed as a series of transformations,
              where the output of one transformation becomes input of the
              subsequent transformation.

              into system requirements & responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;Transformation 2 (design ) begins with a problem statement
              and ends with a detailed design that can be transformed into an
              operational system. It includes the bulk of s/w development
              activity.

              design into the system deployment that will satisfy the users'
              needs. It represents embedding s/w product within its operational
              environment.

            <h4>Benefits of Object Orientation:</h4>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;<strong>Allows higher level of abstraction: </strong>Object
              oriented approach supports abstraction at the object level. Since
              objects encapsulate both data (attributes) & functions (methods),
              they work at a higher level of abstraction. This makes designing,
              coding, testing & maintaining the system much simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;<strong
                >Provides Seamless transition among different phases of software
                development: </strong
              >Object oriented approach, essentially uses the same language to
              talk about analysis, design, programming and database design. This
              seamless approach reduces the level of complexity and redundancy
              and makes for clearer, more robust system development.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;<strong>Encourage good development techniques: </strong>In
              a properly designed system, the routines and attributes within a
              class are held together tightly, the classes will be grouped into
              subsystems but remain independently and therefore, changing one
              class has no impact on other classes and so, the impact is
              minimized.
            </p>
            <p>
              •&nbsp;<strong>Promotes of reusability:</strong> Objects are
              reusable because they are modeled directly out of a real - world
              problem domain. Here classes are designed, with reuse as a
              constant background goal. All the previous functionality remains
              and can be reused without changed.

              Almost all projects will entail similar up-front costs. The
              organization will often have to purchase additional hardware,
              software and communication equipment. These costs can be estimated
              with the help of vendors.

              verifying the schema, tables, triggers, etc., of the application's
              database that is being tested. In Database testing, we create
              complex queries to perform the load or stress test on the database
              and verify the database's responsiveness.

            <p>
              By performing database testing we can guarantee the security and
              reliability of an application as it exposes the vulnerability in
              the database.
            </p>
            <h4>Benefits of Database Testing:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Database testing helps in ensuring the database's efficiency,
                stability, performance, and security.
              </li>
              <li>
                During database testing, we can understand the behavior of
                complex transactions and how the system handles such queries.
              </li>
              <li>
                It makes sure that only valid data values and information are
                received and stored in the database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Database testing protects us from vulnerabilities like data
                loss, saves aborted transaction data, and doesn't allow access
                to information for unauthorized users.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>
              Consider an application that captures the day-to-day transaction
              details for users and stores the details in the database. From
              database testing point of view, the following checks should be
              performed,
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The transactional information from the application should be
                stored in the database and it should provide correct information
                to the user.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information should not be lost when it is loaded to database.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only completed transactions should be stored and all incomplete
                operations should be aborted by the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                Access authorization to database should be maintained. No
                unapproved or unauthorized access to user information should be
                provided.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Client/Server</h4>
            <p>
              Client/server describes the relationship between two computer
              programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request
              from another program, the server, which fulfills the request.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to
              interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across
              different locations. The client/server model has become one of the
              central ideas of network computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Client-server computing is a software engineering technique often
              used within distributed computing that allows two independent
              processes to exchange information, through a dedicated connection,
              following an established protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Client-server system is mainly two different processors that
              exchange information on common server. Unlike peer to peer system
              there is one server that stores the information and gives it only
              when the client provides specific identification like username.
            </p>
            <p>
              Functions such as email exchange, web access and database access,
              are built on the client-server model.

            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>
              To check the bank account from computer, a client program in the
              computer forwards the request to a server program at the bank.
              That program may in turn forward the request to its own client
              program that sends a request to a database server at another bank
              computer to retrieve the account balance. The balance is returned
              back to the bank data client, which in turn serves it back to the
              client in the personal computer, which displays the information
              for us.

              The World Wide Web (abbreviated as WWW or W3, commonly known as
              the Web), is a system of interlinked hypertext documents accessed
              via the Internet. With a web browser, one can view web pages that
              may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia, and
              navigate between them via hyperlinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The World Wide Web was designed as a client/server system. The
              objective was to enable people to share information with their
              colleagues. The clients run browser software that receives and
              displays data files. The servers run web server software that
              answers requests, finds the appropriate files, and sends the
              required data.

              &bull;&nbsp;Cluster analysis or clustering is the assignment of a
              set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that

            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Data clustering improves performance by identifying

              &bull;&nbsp;Data partitioning is a technique to improve
              application performance or security by splitting tables across
              multiple locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Data partitioning is the process of logically or
              physically partitioning data into segments that are more easily
              maintained or accessed.
            </p>
            <h4>Horizontal Partitioning</h4>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Horizontal partitioning is often used to split data so
              that it can be stored in location where it will use the most. It
              involves putting
              <span class="underline">different rows into different tables</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Some of the rows (i.e. active data) will be stored in
              one location and other rows (i.e. inactive data) will be stored in
              a different location. The active data will be stored on high speed
              disk drives.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;The user does not need to know about the split because
              the DBMS automatically retrieve data from either location.
            </p>
            <h4>Vertical Partitioning</h4>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Vertical partitioning involves
              <span class="underline">creating tables with fewer columns</span>
              and using additional tables to store the remaining columns.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;In vertical partitioning active or frequently used
              columns of data are stored on a faster drive, while inactive or
              rarely used columns are moved to a cheaper and slower drives.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Overall performance will improve because the DBMS will
              be able to retrieve more of the smaller rows.
            </p>
            <p>
              &bull;&nbsp;Vertical partitioning is useful for limiting the
              amount of data that need to read into memory.

              The DBMS is preferred over the conventional file processing system
              due to the following advantages,
            </p>
            <h4 class="subject__sub-heading">
              <span>1.</span>
              <span>Minimal Data Redundancy:</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Redundancy means repitition or duplication of data. In DBMS, the
              data redundancy can be controlled or reduced but it is not removed
              completely. By controlling the data redundancy, you can save
              storage space.

              In DBMS, data can be shared by authorized users of the
              organization. The DBA manages the data and gives rights to users
              to access the data. Many users can be authorized to access the

            <h4>Database Engine</h4>
            <p>
              The database engine is the heart of the dbms. The engine is
              responsible for defining, storing and retrieving the data. It
              affects the performance (speed) and the ability to handle large
              problems (scalability). It is a stand-alone component that can be
              purchased and used as an independent software module.
              <span class="underline">Example: Microsoft Jet Engine</span>
            </p>
            <h4>Data Dictionary</h4>
            <p>
              The data dictionary holds the definition of all the tables. A data
              dictionary is a reserved space within a database which is used to
              store information about the database itself i.e. design
              information, user permissions etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Query Processor</h4>
            <p>
              It is the fundamental component of DBMS. It enables developers and
              users to store and retrieve data. All database operations can be
              run through the query language. Query language is processed by the
              query processor.
            </p>
            <h4>Report Writer</h4>
            <p>
              Report is a summarization of database data. It extracts
              information from one or more files and presents the information in
              a specified format.

              The software design concept simply means the idea or principle
              behind the design. It describes how you plan to solve the problem

                >&nbsp;<br />Abstraction simply means to hide the details to
                reduce complexity and increases efficiency or quality. Different
                levels of Abstraction are necessary and must be applied at each
                stage of the design process so that any error that is present
                can be removed to increase the efficiency of the software

                project into smaller parts to reduce the complexity of the
                system or project. In the same way, modularity in design means
                subdividing a system into smaller parts so that these parts can
                be created independently and then use these parts in different
                systems to perform different functions. If the system contains
                fewer components then it would mean the system is complex which
                requires a lot of effort (cost) but if we are able to divide the

                refinement concept of software design is actually a process of
                developing or presenting the software or system in a detailed
                manner that means to elaborate a system or software. Refinement
                is very necessary to find out any error if present and then to
                reduce it.

                In software design, information hiding is achieved by designing
                the modules in a manner that the information gathered or
                contained in one module is hidden and can't be accessed by any
                other modules.

              Testing is the process of executing a program with the aim of
              finding errors. To make our software perform well it should be
              error-free. If testing is done successfully it will remove all the
              errors from the software.

              It focuses on the smallest unit of software design. In this, we
              test an individual unit or group of interrelated units. It is
              often done by the programmer by using sample input and observing
              its corresponding outputs.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a program we are checking if loop, method or function is
                working fine
              </li>

              <span>Integration Testing</span>
            </h4>
            <p>
              The objective is to take unit tested components and build a
              program structure that has been dictated by design. Integration
              testing is testing in which a group of components is combined to
              produce output.
            </p>
            <p>
              Integration testing is of four types: (i) Top-down (ii) Bottom-up
              (iii) Sandwich (iv) Big-Bang
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Black Box testing:</strong> It is used for validation.
                In this we ignore internal working mechanism and focus on
                <span class="underline">what is the output?.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>White Box testing:</strong> It is used for verification.
                In this we focus on internal mechanism i.e.
                <span class="underline">how the output is achieved?</span>

            </h4>
            <p>
              Every time a new module is added leads to changes in the program.
              This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works
              properly even after adding components to the complete program.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In school record suppose we have module staff, students and
                finance combining these modules and checking if on integration
                these module works fine is regression testing

              This test is done to make sure that software under testing is
              ready or stable for further testing It is called a smoke test as
              the testing an initial pass is done to check if it did not catch
              the fire or smoke in the initial switch on.
            </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If project has 2 modules so before going to module make sure
                that module 1 works properly

              operating systems. It is covered under the black box testing
              technique. In this, we just focus on the required input and output
              without focusing on internal working.<br />In this, we have
              security testing, recovery testing, stress testing, and

              and effectiveness of the program. It is also called load testing.
              In it we check, what is the performance of the system in the given

            <p>
              Expert judgement relies on the experience background and business
              sense of one or more key people in an organisation mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: An expert might arrive at a cost estimate in a following
              manner,
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The goal is to estimate the requirements to develop a process
                controll system
              </li>
              <li>
                It is similar to one that was developed last year in 10 months
                at a cost of one million dollar
              </li>
              <li>It was not a respectible profit</li>
              <li>
                The new system has same control functions as the previous but
                25% more control activities. So the time and cost is increased
                by 25%
              </li>
              <li>
                Same computer and controlling devices and many of the same
                people are available to develop the new sysem therefore 20% of
                the estimate is reduced
              </li>
              <li>
                Reusing the low level code from the previous reduces the time
                and cost estimates by 25%
              </li>
              <li>
                This results in the estimation of 8,00,000$ & 8 Months
                development time
              </li>
              <li>
                With a small margin of safety added, it becomes 8,50,000 & 9

              This family of models was proposed by Boehm in 1981. The models
              have been widely accepted in practice. In the COCOMOs, the
              code-size S is given in thousand LOC (KLOC) and efforts is on
              person-month. COCOMO is actually a hierarchy of estimation models
              that address the following areas:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Application composition model:</strong> Used during the
              early stages of software engineering, when prototyping of user
              interfaces, consideration of software and system interaction,
              assessment of performance, and technology maturity are paramount.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Early design stage model:</strong> Used once requirements
              have stabilized and basic software architecture has been
              established.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Post-architecture-stage model:</strong> Used during the
              construction of the software.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Basic COCOMO:</span> This model uses
                  three sets of {a, b} depending only on the complexity of the
                  software.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    For simple, well-understand applications, a = 2.4, b = 1.05;
                  </li>
                  <li>For more complex systems, a = 3.0, b = 1.15;</li>
                  <li>For embedded systems, a = 3.6, b = 1.20;</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <span class="underline">Intermediate & Detailed COCOMO:</span>
                  In the intermediate COCOMO, a nominal effort estimation is
                  obtained using the power function with three sets of {a, b},
                  with coefficient a being slightly different from that of the
                  basic COCOMO.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    For simple, well-understood applications, a = 3.2, b = 1.05;
                  </li>
                  <li>For more complex systems, a = 3.0, b = 1.15;</li>
                  <li>For embedded systems, a= 2.8, b = 1.20;</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Then, fifteen Cost Factors with values ranging from 0.7 to
                  1.66 are determined. The overall impact factor 'M' is obtained
                  as the product of all individual factors, and the estimate is
                  obtained by multiplying 'M' to the nominal estimate
                </p>
                <p>
                  While both basic and intermediate COCOMOs estimate the
                  software cost at the system level, the detailed COCOMO works
                  on each sub-system separately and has an obvious advantage for
                  large systems that contain non-homogenous subsystems.
